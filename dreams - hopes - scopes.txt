🌀 Other interactions 🌀
	📼 Chests have a dice that can be rolled. Lower sided and higher sided dice. On spending some ressource, you could add a dice to the dice roll. Or decide to not roll the dice at all and take the chest as is. Taking the chest gives you an expected quality item or gun for that chest rarity. Rolling can inflence the contents to be better, far worse, or even absolutely scuffed.
	📼 An enemy robot that when you headshot it, drives its head inwards but exposes a new weakpoint at the stomach area - shoot that to drive the head back up

📼 Gun rythms 📼
	Have guns have different bpm cadences:
		| BPM | Seconds per Beat (interval) |
		| 60 | 1.00 sec (1 beat per second) |
		| 120 | 0.50 sec (2 beats per second) |
		| 180 | 0.33 sec (3 beats per second) |

		var bpm = 120  # Example BPM
		var wait_time = 60.0 / bpm
		timer.wait_time = wait_time
	Fill the arrays for gun sounds with different accentuations. 4/4 beats with hits on one, or offbeat clutter sounds. Imagine psytrance beats and how they put the base between the beats, etc. Take real life tangible songs for the bpms!
	I could work with the shell-casings plings for example too. Hisses, clicks, clacks. Should probably do FL first and then see how to implement, but i think it'll work.

📼 General 'feel' 📼
	Yes Synthetik spectacle but ...
