I dont feel well today ...

What happened to me?

I havent felt well in some time.

Why is it locked?

Who locked it?

Where are my keys?

Where is my mind?

I feel dry.

The dirty compartment needs my time.

My keys are gone.

My aunt has a second pair of keys. 

I should visit her.

It hurts when i think about it.

This is mold.

It hurts when i breathe in.

Bottles.

We lost as much when we were born as we will lose when we die. All.

Only what arises from the feeling is real.

My laughter disappeared. Then my smile.

This cant be good for me and i feel worse.

I've worsened.

I'm a shade of my former self.

The doorbell is turned off.

I'm scared.

I'm tired.

Laundry.

The laundry is moldy.

It's not going well.

I'm not doing fine.

It ain't what it ain't.

I can not bear it anymore.

Unbearable.

I can not continue like this.

I need to change.

This needs to change.

I dont like it here.

I dont enjoy it here.

I dont appreciate this.

I never asked for this.

I dont know what to do.

When did this all happen?

When did this all begin?

I'm not adequate.

Will I collapse?

Will I still be able to stand upright?

That everything has been said. That there is nothing more to say. You know it. You can feel it.

I have deepened only one idea, namely that everything that man accomplishes necessarily turns against him.

A thought that is not secretly marked by a warning sign is no good. It's just a thought.

I should change my name. I am no longer the same anyway.

I don't doubt my abilities. I just don't have any.

The sleepless nights consume my last remnant of reason.

Every person said what he had to say. Now he should rest.

The heightened awareness of having a body, that's exactly what lack of health is. In other words, I was never healthy.

Dispossession and exhaustion.

To be alive. This expression strikes me as if it doesn't fit anyone.

The obsession with the idea of birth, which leads me behind my past, spoils my taste for the future at the same time.

Days struck by mysterious barrenness.

I react like everyone else, and even like those I despise the most.

This place is a prison.
