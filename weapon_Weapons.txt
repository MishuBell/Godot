Weapon mechanics

Weapon-Rythms
Have guns have different bpm cadences:

| BPM | Seconds per Beat (interval) |
| 60 | 1.00 sec (1 beat per second) |
| 120 | 0.50 sec (2 beats per second) |
| 180 | 0.33 sec (3 beats per second) |

var bpm = 120  # Example BPM
var wait_time = 60.0 / bpm
timer.wait_time = wait_time

Fill the arrays for gun sounds with different accentuations. 4/4 beats with hits on one, or offbeat clutter sounds. Imagine psytrance beats and how they put the base between the beats, etc. Take real life tangible songs for the bpms!

I could work with the shell-casings plings for example too. Hisses, clicks, clacks. Should probably do FL first and then see how to implement, but i think it'll work.


Bullet pattern  
Animate the model inside its local  
Can make the hitboxes to that it doesnt suck also  

Weapon bobbing  
Super light  

Weapon sway  
Just a little bit, subtle  

Reloading  
Definitely have reloading. Its a sensual experience too.  
Clean reload -> Takes longer, no jamming - full bar  
Fast reload -> can jam bullets - hit reload a second time  
Make it like in Synthetik. Hit the right spot, have a clean reload  
Can be used for further bonuses
