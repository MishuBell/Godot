Company Something to make you not feel alone.
Think: ORDIS, Pixies in BDL

Hitboxes
Dont get stuck on things, smooth hitboxes. No "no go" areas.

Chests  
A tremendous amount of chest and openable stuff!!  

Collect  
Make collecting a sensual experience by having a collect button  
Is instant, but on hold - takes everything in the area. Very satifsying  

Game feel  
Somewhat floaty, yes. Jumping also. A little floaty  

Badass Rank system  
Get points for all sort of shit and spend them, super satisfying  

Texturing: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.  
Look at Borderlands 2, Tiny Tina and Borderlands 1.  
THE FUCKING TEXTURES DONT EVEN TILE. LIKE ... THEY ARENT EVEN UNWRAPPED.  
Please chill the FUCK out with your stupid ass """""perfectionism""""" you arent even GOOD ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT PERFECTIONISM.
