Mission I : Rododendron  

The GASTRO system — a once-revolutionary, fully automated food distribution network—was designed to deliver MEAL capsules to apartments, where home units seamlessly convert them into revitalized meals. It was built for efficiency, requiring little to no maintenance. Over time, however, it became a forgotten relic, running mindlessly without oversight, quietly accumulating its own organic chaos deep in the city’s underbelly.  

With no human intervention, spilled MEAL capsules piled up, decaying into thick layers of nutrient-rich mold. From this unattended mess, a sprawling, anomalous flower emerged—dubbed the Rododendron, a strange organism thriving on the remains of automated neglect. Its pollen spread widely, seeping into the city’s hidden spaces and affecting its most unsuspecting inhabitants: the rat population.  

The effects were bizarre. The rats became sentient, their minds awakened by the strange floral mutation. Driven by newfound intelligence and an overwhelming instinct to expand their dominion, they formed a war council, officially declaring a nationwide state of emergency. Their singular goal? To claim more LEBENSRAUM — a movement as ambitious as it is utterly ridiculous.  

Through some questionable ingenuity, they discovered a way to infiltrate the MEAL distribution system, inserting themselves into capsules bound for revitalization in home units. Upon activation, instead of nutritious meals, fully energized rats emerge in apartments, much to the horror (or amusement) of unsuspecting residents. Though they charge forward with a militant fervor, their uprising is less a true threat and more a whimsical spectacle of misguided ambition. After all— they are just rats.  


Tone/Vibe:  
A world abandoned to automation, where forgotten systems evolve into unpredictable chaos  
A hilariously misguided rodent revolution, filled with over-the-top declarations of conquest  
A deep dystopian undercurrent masked with absurd humor
